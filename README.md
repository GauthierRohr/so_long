SO_LONG

so_long is a 2D game project from 42 School that introduces basic graphics programming using MiniLibX. The goal is to create a small game where the player moves through a map, collecting items and reaching an exit while following specific constraints.

Features :
	•	Loads and displays a .ber map with different elements (walls, player, collectibles, exit)
	•	Player movement using keyboard inputs
	•	Validates the map format and ensures a valid path to the exit
	•	Displays the number of moves taken
	•	Handles errors and ensures a clean program exit

Constraints :
	•	Uses MiniLibX for graphics
	•	Grid-based movement (no advanced collision handling)
	•	The map must be rectangular and properly formatted

This project serves as an introduction to event handling and texture management in C.
